# Kosh is a searchable archive for multimedia content.

## Why does it exist?

In order to amplify the work of fact checkers, it is important to store the large amount of media - text, images, videos circulating on chat apps and closed content eco-system. It is also important to be able to search for this media in order to reduce the redundancy of their work.

Kosh empowers small and big media outfits to archive and annotate media that they find circulating on various social media that could be potential misinformation or trigger violence. The ability to have autonomous operations enables small teams to focus on their area of interest and expertise. It could be limited to a geographical region or one genre of misinformation like healthcare. Organizations can join forces with other federated Khoj archives that they trust, eventually joining forces to become a trusted media archive that can be used for quick searches to verify the source of a media item. Since trust is built over time and needs to be continually built, Khoj would help make the data in all the archives - the media itself and its metadata, as open as possible, to enable third party independent investigations too.
